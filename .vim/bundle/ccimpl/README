This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1146

This script defines a function Implement(), that when called from a C++ header file generates a skeleton implementation of the classes defined in the header, in a new vertical window.

This is great for defining and documenting the interface to a class and then using this function to generate a skeleton implementation to be filled in.

TODO: Handle functions outside of classes and thus C compatibility.
            Implement static member initialization.
